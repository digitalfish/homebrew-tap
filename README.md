# DigitalFish homebrew-tap

Customized homebrew packages for convenience.

## cmake@3 

This is a fork of the last of the cmake 3.x series formulas before the
homebrew community moved forward to cmake 4.

Uninstall git if you have it installed already to allow linking this formula:

    brew uninstall cmake

Install this formula. There are no pre-built “bottles” here; the formula builds from source.

    brew tap digitalfish/tap
    brew install digitalfish/tap/cmake@3
